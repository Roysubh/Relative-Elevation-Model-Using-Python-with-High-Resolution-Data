#Relative Elevation Model Using Python with High-Resolution Data

Overview:
This project demonstrates how to generate Relative Elevation Models (REMs) using high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Python. The workflow combines advanced geospatial analysis and visualization techniques, allowing users to extract meaningful insights about terrain and river flowlines. By leveraging open-source tools like py3dep and pynhd, this project provides an efficient method for analyzing elevation data and creating high-quality visual outputs.

The main highlights include river profiling, DEM interpolation using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), and the generation of REMs to study terrain elevation relative to specific features, such as river networks.

Features:
  Retrieve and Visualize DEM Data
  Download high-resolution DEM data from the USGS 3DEP service using the py3dep library and visualize it effectively.
  
  River Flowline Analysis
  Extract river flowline data from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and overlay it on DEM data for better context.
  
  Elevation Profiling
  Create elevation profiles along river flowlines to study changes in terrain height.
  
  IDW Interpolation
  Use Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to interpolate DEM values from river profiles to create smooth elevation models.
  
  Relative Elevation Model (REM)
  Calculate the difference between the DEM and interpolated elevation to generate a REM, highlighting terrain deviations.
  
  Hillshade Rendering
  Render hillshade maps for enhanced 3D-like visualization of terrain features.

Installation:
  To run this project, install the required Python libraries:
    pip install matplotlib xarray xrspatial datashader py3dep pynhd shapely scipy  
  
  Open the Code.ipynb script or run the code in a Jupyter Notebook.
  
  Update the bounding box (bbox) for the region of interest in the script to match your study area:
  bbox = (-91.3817, 43.3235, -91.1209, 43.7881) 

  Run the script to:
    Download DEM data.
    Extract and visualize river flowlines.
    Generate interpolated elevation models using IDW.
    Visualize and save results as images.

Key Outputs:
  Flowline and DEM Visualization
    Displays river flowlines overlaid on DEM data.
  
  River Elevation Profile
    Graph of elevation changes along the river flowline.
  
  Relative Elevation Model (REM)
